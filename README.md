# CS-330

I approach my design skills very much by trial and error. While having taken this class twice, I have gotten better at understand how and what to change in order to provide the design I have in my head. THe process I take is very one step at a time. I will change something, and test it to ensure it works. If it fails, then I will not have to re-do all the code or search it for the error. This could be used in my future by just taking little increments at a time, and applying them. If I take put down a ton of work at all once without making sure or testing it little by little, that leaves a lot of room for error.

In working through all of these milestones, I did enjoy how they all built on each other. It gave me a good sense confidence to be able to improve upon my already developed program. My thought process has also changed in the matter of being able to not only complete the milestone, but being able to do it in a timely manner. In  the real world, being able to provide the result in a much quicker and efficient fashion goes a long way to the customer.


 Again, by having taken this class twice now, I really struggled with it and had to have a lot of tutor help in order to get through it. The concepts and struggles I have had in this class I know will never be forgotten, because it has taught me how to overcome them. I will be able to use these concepts in my everyday world and job in order to make myself stand out in the Information Technology Industry.
